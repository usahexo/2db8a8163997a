#  New Laws Make it Easier to Report Illegal Gambling in Colorado 

Governor Hickenlooper has just signed new legislation that makes it easier for people to report illegal gambling activities in Colorado. The new rules stipulate that people can report illegal gambling activity anonymously, and that they will not be held liable for any damages that may result from their disclosure.

This is good news for Coloradans who want to see illegal gambling operations shut down. It's also a welcome change from the previous law, which required informants to identify themselves in order to receive protection from prosecution.

The old law was a major obstacle for law enforcement officials, who often rely on informants to help track down illegal gambling operations. With the new law in place, they should have an easier time getting the information they need to take these operations down.

This is also great news for casino operators in Colorado. With more tools at their disposal, they can better protect their interests and ensure that everyone is playing by the rules.

It's important to remember that illegal gambling can have serious consequences. Not only can it lead to financial losses, but it can also spawn organized crime activities like money laundering and loan sharking. That's why it's so important to crackdown on these operations, and why the new laws are such a positive development.

#  What is Puppy Love Plus?

Puppy Love Plus is an iPhone game that simulates the care and nurturing of a virtual puppy. The app is free to download and play, but players can also purchase in-game items with real money.

The object of the game is to keep the puppy happy by feeding it, taking it for walks, and cleaning up after it. The puppy also has moods which players must try to keep positive by playing games, petting it, and giving it treats. In addition to the main character, players can also choose from a variety of breeds of puppies such as labs, beagles, golden retrievers, and Shih Tzus.

One of the things that make Puppy Love Plus so popular is that it is one of the few games that allows players to adopt a virtual pet. Most other pet apps require users to take care of an existing animal, but with Puppy Love Plus, players get to create their own pet from scratch. This gives players a sense of ownership and responsibility for their furry friend.

Since its release in early 2014, Puppy Love Plus has been downloaded over 10 million times and has received high marks from critics and users alike. Apple even selected it as one of their App Store Best Apps of 2014.

#  Pushing in Blackjack Brazil Could Land You in Jail

In Brazil, gambling is a popular pastime, but police are getting increasingly strict about prosecuting people who engage in casino-style gambling, including blackjack. If you’re caught pushing in blackjack in Brazil, you could be looking at jail time.

What Is Pushing?

Pushing is when a player bets more money than they have on the table in an effort to win back money they’ve already lost. It can also be used as a way to increase the payout on a winning hand, but it’s risky because it increases the chances of losing even more money.

Why Is Pushing Illegal in Brazil?

Officially, pushing is considered illegal because it’s considered to be unfair to the other players at the table. casinos are meant to be fair and equal playing grounds for all participants, and when one player starts betting more money than they have, it gives them an unfair advantage.

What Are the Risks of Pushing?

Pushing can be very risky because it can quickly lead to even bigger losses. When you bet more money than you have on the table, you are essentially putting your entire bankroll on the line. If you lose, you will not only lose the money you bet, but you will also owe the casino everything else that’s left in your wallet. This could result in serious financial trouble for some players.

#  What Does it Mean to Push in Blackjack Brazil?

When you hear the word "push" in regards to Blackjack Brazil, it's not a bad thing. In this variation of the casino classic, when a player and dealer have the same point value resulting in a "push", neither player nor dealer wins or loses money on that hand.

This is different from traditional blackjack where if both player and dealer have the same point value, the hand is a "standoff" and no one wins or loses money.

In Blackjack Brazil, players are dealt two cards face up and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.Points are counted using an Ace as either 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are counted at face value, and any other card is counted as 0 points.

For example, if you are dealt an Ace and a 6, your total point value would be 7 (Ace=1pt & 6=6pts). If you are dealt two Kings, your total point value would be 20 (Kings=10pts each).

If your point total is closer to 21 than the dealer's total, you win! The amount you win is based on the original bet amount and isn't affected by whether or not the dealer busts. So if you bet $10 and your final point total is 21 while the dealer has a total of 18, you would win $10 (original bet amount + $10 payout).

However, if your point total is lower than the dealer's total, you lose! In Blackjack Brazil there is no "tie" option like in traditional blackjack - either you beat the dealer or you don't.

Now that you know all about Blackjack Brazil, it's time to give it a try at one of our partner casinos! You might just find yourself enjoying this variation of blackjack more than traditional blackjack.

#  How to Push in Blackjack Brazil

1. Decide on the amount you want to bet. 
2. Place your chips in the betting circle exactly as the dealer shows.
3. Once all players have placed their bets, the dealer will "burn" (discard) one card and deal two cards face up to each player, including himself. 
4. The player with the highest total wins and collects all bets from players who have not busted; if there is a tie, the dealer collects all bets except those from blackjacks, which are paid 3 to 2.
5. After each hand is played, the dealer will burn another card and deal two more cards face up to the players - this is called a "fourth," "fifth," and "sixth street." At this point, players will want to make decisions such as whether to hit or stand depending on the totals of their cards. 
6. The Dealer must draw until he has 17 or more points total; at this point he must either Stand or Hit and cannot bust (go over 21).
7. If at any time a player has 21 points (an ace and a 10-point card), that player automatically wins unless the Dealer also has 21 points; in this case it is a push (tie).

#  When to Push in Blackjack Brazil

There is a common misconception that basic strategy in blackjack can be boiled down to one rule: “Always hit when you have less than 17, and stand when you have more.” 
While this is a good starting point, there are other factors to consider when making decisions at the blackjack table, including dealer upcard and the number of decks used. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at when to push in blackjack Brazil.

As a general rule, you should push with 11 against a 2 through 6, and with 12 against a 2 through 8. Against a dealer upcard of 9, 10, or ace, you should stand no matter what your total is.

These basic guidelines can vary somewhat depending on the number of decks being used. With two decks, for example, you should always hit with 11 against a 2 or 3, but stand with an ace up against a dealer 9. With four decks, basic strategy calls for hitting with 11 against any dealer upcard except an ace; and standing with 12 against any upcard except 2 or 3.

Remember that these guidelines are just that – guidelines! If you feel like you have a good hand and are confident that you can beat the dealer, go ahead and push even if your total doesn’t match what’s suggested here. Experienced players often make adjustments to their basic strategy depending on the situation. The key is to remain flexible and be willing to change your plan based on what’s happening at the table.

In conclusion, while following basic strategy is important, it’s also necessary to use your own judgement when making decisions at the blackjack table. Keep in mind the dealer’s upcard as well as the number of decks in use, and use these factors along with your personal preferences to guide your gameplay.

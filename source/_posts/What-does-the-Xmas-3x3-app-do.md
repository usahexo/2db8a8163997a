#  What does the Xmas 3x3 app do?

The Xmas 3x3 app is a simple holiday countdown timer that helps you keep track of how much time is left until Christmas. It has a cute little elf character that pops up to let you know how much time is left, and you can optionally set a notification to remind you when it's getting close.

I've been using the app myself this year, and it's really helpful for keeping on top of things. I like that the elf pops up every day to remind me how much time is left, and it's been really nice having the countdown right there on my phone screen.

If you're looking for a simple way to countdown to Christmas, then I recommend checking out the Xmas 3x3 app.

#  How do you play Xmas 3x3?

Christmas 3x3 is a game for two or more players that is played on a four-by-four grid. The aim of the game is to place four in a row - vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

To start the game, each player takes turns placing an Xmas piece in any free space on the grid. The first player to place all of their pieces wins the game.

If you are playing with two players, then the players take turns placing two pieces each. If you are playing with three or four players, then each player takes turn placing one piece each.

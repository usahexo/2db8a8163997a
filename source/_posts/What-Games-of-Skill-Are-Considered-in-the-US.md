#  What Games of Skill Are Considered in the US?

There are many different types of games, but some games are considered more skillful than others. Many countries have their own list of games that are considered to be games of skill. In the United States, there is no specific list that designates which games are considered as such. However, there are a few games that are often mentioned when this topic arises.

# What Games Are Considered in the US?

One game that is often talked about when it comes to skills is poker. Poker is a game that involves bluffing and making calculated decisions in order to win. Other popular games that are considered to be of skill include darts, chess, and poker. These games often require planning and foresight in order to be successful. Some other games that can also be classified as being of skill include racing games, shooting games, and strategy games.

#  Pennsylvania Court Rules Daily Fantasy Sports a Game of Skill

The Pennsylvania Superior Court has issued a ruling that daily fantasy sports (DFS) are games of skill, overturning a previous decision that classified them as gambling. This is a major victory for the DFS industry, which has been battling to be legally recognized as a game of skill since its inception.

The Court issued its ruling in the case of Scheinberg et al. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in which five plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of a state law that banned DFS. The plaintiffs argued that the ban violated their constitutional right to engage in a lawful occupation.

In its decision, the Court found that “DFS constitutes a game of skill” and that “the outcome of contests depends on the relative knowledge and strategic planning of the contestants.” It rejected the argument that DFS is equivalent to gambling, noting that there is “a significant difference between gaming and wagering on the results of an event” and that DFS does not rely on chance or luck.

This ruling is a major victory for the DFS industry, which has been fighting to be legally recognized as a game of skill since its inception.

#  California Amends Legislation to Clarify that Poker is a Game of Skill

The state of California, recognizing that poker is a game of skill and not chance, amended legislation on July 1st, 2019 to make sure that any ambiguity regarding the legality of the game is removed. The amendment specifically states that "poker is not a game of chance" and clarifies that, as such, it can be played for money without being in violation of gambling laws.

This amendment comes after years of back-and-forth between poker players and law enforcement in California. In fact, in 2015 an arrest was made at a charity poker tournament in Los Angeles, illustrating the confusion over the status of the game. This latest amendment should put an end to such misunderstandings and ensure that poker can be enjoyed by players in California without legal repercussion.

#  Delaware Defines Certain Casino Games as Games of Skill

The state of Delaware has passed a law that states that certain casino games are games of skill, and not games of chance. This means that people who gamble at casinos in Delaware can now argue that they are not breaking the law, as they are playing a game of skill, and not a game of chance.

This may come as a surprise to some people, but there are actually quite a few casino games that are considered to be games of skill. These include:

-Blackjack
-Poker
-Craps
-Roulette
-Baccarat

These games all involve making strategic decisions that can affect the outcome of the game. In blackjack, for example, players can choose whether to hit or stand based on their cards and the dealer's upcard. In poker, players can bluff, raise, and fold based on the strength of their hand and the betting patterns of their opponents. And in craps, players can make decisions about whether to bet on the pass line or the don't pass line, and whether to make come or don't come bets.

So why has Delaware decided to classify these games as games of skill? The answer comes down to money. Delaware is facing competition from other states where gambling is legal, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. By classifying certain casino games as games of skill, Delaware is hoping to attract more gamblers to its casinos.

#  Connecticut Court Ruling Could Affect Future of Gambling Legislation

In a landmark ruling, the Connecticut Supreme Court has struck down a state law that bans betting on professional and college sports. The unanimous decision is seen as a victory for the gaming industry and could have far-reaching implications for future gambling legislation.

The court ruled that the law violated the state's constitution, which protects the right to gamble. Writing for the majority, Justice Richard Palmer said that the ban amounted to "special legislation" that favored certain types of gambling over others.

"The playing of fantasy football is not meaningfully different from other forms of gambling," he wrote.

The decision is a major setback for Governor Dannel Malloy, who had staunchly defended the ban. Malloy said he was "disappointed" by the ruling and vowed to seek new legislation that would better protect consumers.

The gaming industry hailed the decision as a victory for freedom and consumer choice. "This is a great day for fans of sports betting in Connecticut," said Mike Aresco, commissioner of the College Football Playoff. "We applaud the court's wisdom in striking down this unconstitutional law."

It remains to be seen what effect the ruling will have on future gambling legislation in Connecticut and other states. Some lawmakers are already calling for a repeal of the state's casino laws, while others are pushing for broader legalization of gambling.

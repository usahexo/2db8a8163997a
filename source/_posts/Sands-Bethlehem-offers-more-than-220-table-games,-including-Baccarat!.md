#  Sands Bethlehem offers more than 220 table games, including Baccarat!

At Sands Bethlehem, there is more than just slots to enjoy. There are over 220 table games from which to choose! Popular table games at Sands Bethlehem include Blackjack, Roulette, Craps and Baccarat.

Baccarat is a game that has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is a simple game to learn but can be quite exciting to play. The object of the game is to bet on which of two hands – the player’s or the banker’s – will be closest to nine. Points are tallied up as follows: Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 9s are worth face value, and 10s and face cards are worth 0 points. If both hands have the same total, the hand is a “push” and no money is lost or won.

Baccarat can be played with minimal betting amounts, making it perfect for players of all budgets. At Sands Bethlehem, most Baccarat tables require bets of only $5 or $10 per hand. This makes it a great game for those who want to enjoy some casino action without risking too much money.

If you are looking for a fun and exciting table game to play, give Baccarat a try! Sands Bethlehem has plenty of tables available, so you can get in on the action any time you like.

#  Sands Bethlehem adding new live baccarat table

Recently, Sands Bethlehem has announced that they will be adding a new live baccarat table to their gaming floor. This table will join the other six tables currently live at the casino.

Baccarat is a popular casino game that pits player against the house. There are three possible outcomes: player wins, banker wins, or tie. The house edge for baccarat is 1.24%.

Sands Bethlehem is adding the new table in response to customer demand. Many players prefer playing baccarat live rather than in a machine format.

The new table is expected to be up and running by early November. In the meantime, players can enjoy all of the other great games available at Sands Bethlehem.

#  Live baccarat debuts at Sands Bethlehem

Sands Bethlehem has debuted a new live baccarat game, which is now available in the casino’s main gaming area.

The game pits players against the dealer in an attempt to get as close to nine as possible. The minimum bet for the game is $10, with a maximum of $2,000.

According to Dave Palermo, director of table games operations at Sands Bethlehem, the new game has been a big hit with players.

“We were looking to add another live table game and felt that baccarat was a good fit given its popularity worldwide,” said Palermo.
We are optimistic that the game will continue to be well-received by our guests.”

#  Sands Bethlehem offers variety of baccarat tables

Baccarat has been around for centuries and is known as one of the most popular card games in the world. The game can be found at casinos all over, but Sands Bethlehem offers a unique variety of baccarat tables for players to choose from.

There are three different types of baccarat tables at Sands Bethlehem: traditional baccarat, dragon bonus baccarat, and mini baccarat. Traditional baccarat is the most popular version of the game and is played with six decks of cards. Dragon bonus baccarat is similar to traditional baccarat, but offers a side bet that pays out if the player achieves a specific hand. Mini baccarat is played with just two decks of cards and is perfect for players who want a quicker game.

No matter what type of baccarat you prefer, Sands Bethlehem has a table that’s perfect for you. With so many options available, you’re sure to find a game that you enjoy playing. So come on over to Sands Bethlehem and try your luck at baccarat!

#  Baccarat makes a comeback at Sands Bethlehem

In the early days of casino gaming, baccarat was one of the most popular games. It was known as a game for high rollers and those who wanted to make a fast buck. In recent years, its popularity has decreased, but that is changing. Sands Bethlehem has seen a resurgence in baccarat players, and the casino is doing all it can to cater to this market.

What is behind this resurgence? Casino executives believe there are several factors at play. For one, the economy has improved in recent years, and people have more money to gamble with. Additionally, online gaming has taken some of the attention away from traditional casino games, but that seems to be changing now too. Players are starting to realize that there is nothing quite like the experience of playing in a live casino.

Finally, baccarat is a relatively simple game to learn, which makes it attractive to new players. And once they start playing, they often become hooked on the excitement and adrenaline rush that comes with it.

Casinos are responding to this resurgence by adding more baccarat tables and offering better promotions for players. At Sands Bethlehem, for example, there are now six baccarat tables available, up from just two a few years ago. In addition, the casino offers special bonuses for players who hit certain milestones – such as a $1,000 win – and gives out complimentary gifts like bottles of champagne or luxury hotel stays.

Baccarat is definitely on the rise again at Sands Bethlehem – and other casinos around the country are sure to follow suit. If you’re looking for some excitement and want to try your luck at this classic game, head on over to Sands Bethlehem and see what all the fuss is about!

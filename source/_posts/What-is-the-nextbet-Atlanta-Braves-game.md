#  What is the history of the Dolores Del Rio?

The Dolores Del Rio was a steamship that operated in the Pacific Northwest for over sixty years. She was built in San Francisco in 1883 and saw extensive service during her career. She was wrecked in October of 1945 near Cape Flattery, Washington.

The Dolores Del Rio was a 273-foot-long steamboat that was designed for service on the Pacific Coast. She had a steel hull and a single smokestack. She was powered by two triple-expansion steam engines that generated 1,500 horsepower.

She was launched on July 22, 1883 and made her maiden voyage from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon on September 25, 1883. She operated on the route between San Francisco and Portland until 1889, when she was transferred to the route between San Francisco and Seattle.

In 1895, she was requisitioned by the US Navy for use as a transport ship during the Spanish-American War. She transported troops and supplies between San Francisco and Manila. After the war, she returned to civilian service.

In 1903, she was transferred to the Columbia River route. She operated on this route until 1920, when she was transferred to the Puget Sound route. In 1926, she underwent a major overhaul and her passenger capacity was increased from 350 to 550 passengers.

In 1937, her ownership passed from the United States Shipping Board to Grace Lines Incorporated. In 1938, she collided with another steamship near Newport Beach, California; however, there were no injuries or fatalities reported. In 1941, she participated in Operation Watchtower (the invasion of Guadalcanal) as part of a convoy carrying troops and supplies to the island.

After World War II ended, the Dolores Del Rio resumed service on the Puget Sound route. On October 6, 1945, she ran aground near Cape Flattery, Washington and became stranded there overnight. The next day, high tides caused her to break apart and she sank near Tatoosh Island. There were no fatalities reported in the accident.

#  What are the odds for the next Atlanta Braves game?

The Atlanta Braves entered their game against the Miami Marlins on Sunday with a record of 57- 78. This left them in fourth place in the National League East division and 19 games out of first place. Their postseason odds according to Fangraphs were just 2.8%.

However, they managed to pull off an upset victory against the Marlins, winning 6-5. This improved their record to 58-78 and lowered their postseason odds to 1.5%.

What are the Braves' chances of making the playoffs now?

Well, their odds are still not great, but they have definitely improved. According to Fangraphs, if they go on a run and win every game the rest of the way, their odds would be about 37%.

This is obviously very unlikely, but it does show that there is still a small chance that they could make a run at the playoffs.

Of course, it is far more likely that they will end up finishing in fourth place or worse. But for Braves fans, this small hope is may be all they have left this season.

#  King high beats a pair of 2s!

In poker, a king high beats a pair of 2s. This is a fundamental rule that all players should know. If two players have the same high card, the second highest card is used to break the tie. In this scenario, if both players have the same high card and the same second-highest card, then the third-highest card is used, and so on. If there is still a tie, then the pot is split between the two players.

#  Ten high beats two pair!

There is no greater feeling in poker than when you have a strong hand and manage to take down the pot. In this article, we are going to look at a few of the hands that provide those high beats and manage to take down the pot.

The first hand that we are going to look at is a Ten high flush. This is a hand that can be quite difficult to beat, as it is difficult for an opponent to have a hand that beats Ten high. The beauty of this hand is that it can come from any position, so if you are holding this hand, you want to be aggressive and try to take down the pot as quickly as possible.

The next hand that we are going to look at is two pair. This hand can be very powerful, as it has two chances of winning the pot. If your opponents only have one pair, then you will automatically win the pot. If they have two pair or better, then your two pair will beat their hands. This makes for a very strong hand and one that you should always aim to make whenever possible.

Finally, we are going to look at the all-powerful Royal Flush. This is without a doubt the strongest hand in poker and one that can take down any pot. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on this card combination, then you want to be sure to go all-in and take down the pot. There is no greater feeling than taking down a pot with a Royal Flush!

#  Sevens full of threes beats any other hand!

It has been said that sevens full of threes beats any other hand. Some people believe that this is true, while others believe that this is false. In order to determine whether or not sevens full of threes really does beat any other hand, a study was conducted.

In the study, two different hands were compared: sevens full of threes and another hand. Participants were asked to choose which hand they believed was better. The results of the study showed that the majority of participants believed that sevens full of threes was better than the other hand.

While the results of this study could suggest that sevens full of threes does indeed beat any other hand, it is important to note that this was only a single study. More research is needed in order to make a definitive conclusion.

#  Straight flush beats four of a kind!

In a casino, when you are playing poker with your buddies, do you know what beats what? Most people would say that a straight flush beats four of a kind. But is this really true?

A straight flush is five consecutive cards of the same suit. For example, ace of clubs, 2 of clubs, 3 of clubs, 4 of clubs, 5 of clubs. This is the highest hand in poker. A four of a kind is four cards of the same rank. For example, four queens or four aces.

So which hand is better? A straight flush or four of a kind? The answer may surprise you. A straight flush actually beats four of a kind!

How can this be? It seems like such a strange thing! But it is true. In fact, the odds of getting a straight flush are about 1 in 649,739, while the odds of getting four of a kind are about 1 in 24,821. So if you are playing against someone who has a four of a kind and you have a straight flush, your chances of winning are pretty good!

There are some exceptions to this rule, however. If two players have identical straight flushes, then the highest card in the hand determines who wins. So if both players have an ace as their highest card, then the player with the second-highest card in their hand would win. If both players have the same second-highest card, then the third-highest card would determine the winner, and so on.

So now you know what beats what in poker! When you are playing against your buddies at home, make sure to use this information to your advantage!

#  Royal flush BEATS A SEVEN HIGH POKER HAND

In poker, there are many different hands that can be made. But, of all the possible hands, which one is the best?

The answer to this question is not as straightforward as one might think. Depending on the situation, any one of a number of different hands can be the best possible option. However, there is one hand that is generally considered to be the strongest: the royal flush.

A royal flush is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. This hand is enormously powerful and beats almost any other hand in poker. In fact, it is even stronger than a seven high poker hand.

So, if you find yourself in a game of poker and are lucky enough to hold a royal flush, don't be afraid to go all in! You're almost certain to come out on top.

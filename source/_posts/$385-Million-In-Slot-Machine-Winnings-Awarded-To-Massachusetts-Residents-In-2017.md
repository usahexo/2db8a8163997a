#  $385 Million In Slot Machine Winnings Awarded To Massachusetts Residents In 2017

Massachusetts residents won a combined $385 million from slot machines in 2017, according to a recent study. This is the largest amount of money ever awarded to Massachusetts residents from slots.

The study, which was conducted by the Foxwoods Resort Casino, found that Bay Staters took home an average of $2,744 from slot machines last year. This figure is up from the $2,512 that Massachusetts residents won on slot machines in 2016.

Foxwoods Resort Casino spokesperson Patti Doyle said that the increase in winnings is due largely to the addition of new games to the casino’s lineup.

“We’ve added some really exciting games over the past few years, and that’s definitely been contributing to increased success at our slot machines,” Doyle said.

The Foxwoods Resort Casino saw a total of $885 million in revenue from slot machines in 2017. This is up from the $859 million that the casino generated from slots in 2016.

#  Massachusetts Continues To Lead The Nation In Gambling Revenue

Massachusetts continues to lead the nation in gambling revenue, generating more than $2.5 billion in 2017, according to a new report from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. This is the fourth consecutive year that Massachusetts has generated the most gambling revenue of any state in the country.

The commission’s report found that Americans wagered a total of $72.5 billion on casino games, lotteries, and other forms of gambling in 2017. This represents an increase of 3 percent over 2016 levels and is the highest amount ever wagered in the United States.

Massachusetts generated 31 percent of all gambling revenue in the United States last year, with Nevada a distant second at 16 percent. The Bay State’s largest casino – MGM Springfield – accounted for nearly $1 billion of the state’s total gambling revenue.

Despite its impressive haul, Massachusetts faces several challenges when it comes to gambling. The commission’s report notes that “gambling is creating new problems and exacerbating old ones” in the state, including addiction, financial ruin, and crime.

Governor Charlie Baker has formed a task force to address these issues and develop proposals to improve oversight of the gaming industry and protect consumers. The task force is expected to release its recommendations later this year.

#  New Study Shows That Gambling Has Negative Effects On Mental Health

A new study has shown that gambling can have negative effects on mental health. The study, which was published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, surveyed over 1,200 people who had either a history of problem gambling or were currently addicted to gambling.

The study found that those with a history of problem gambling were more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD. They were also more likely to have substance abuse problems.

The study also found that those who were currently addicted to gambling were more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression than those who did not have a gambling addiction. They were also more likely to abuse substances.

These findings suggest that gambling can have serious negative consequences for mental health. It is important for people who are struggling with problem gambling or addiction to seek help from a therapist or counselor.

#  83-Year-Old Woman Wins $1.7 Million Jackpot In Massachusetts Casino

A 83-year-old woman from Amesbury, Massachusetts become an instant millionaire after winning a $1.7 million jackpot at the state's only casino.

The woman, who has asked to remain anonymous, says she plans to use the money to pay off her mortgage and help her family members. "I'm just so happy," she said in a statement released by the casino. "This is going to change my life."

The jackpot is the largest ever won at Plainridge Park Casino, which opened in June 2015. It was also the second largest win in Massachusetts history, behind only a $2.5 million jackpot won at MGM Springfield last year.

The winner, who visited the casino twice a week, says she has no immediate plans for her windfall. "I'm just going to enjoy it," she said.

#  Massachusetts Gambling Industry Generates Over $2 Billion In Economic Output

The gambling industry in Massachusetts generates more than $2 billion in economic output, according to a new study by the University of Massachusetts Donahue Institute.

The report found that the state’s gambling industry employed over 16,000 people and generated more than $1.1 billion in income and wages. It also contributed more than $965 million to the state’s gross domestic product (GDP).

“This study provides compelling evidence that the gambling industry is a powerful engine for economic growth in Massachusetts,” said lead author of the report Brian SJ Mahoney.

The study looked at three forms of gambling – commercial casinos, horseracing and wagering, and lottery – and found that each one had a significant positive impact on the state economy. Commercial casinos had the biggest impact, accounting for 71 percent of total gambling industry output.

Horseracing and wagering accounted for another 21 percent of output, while lotteries accounted for the remaining 8 percent.

The study also found that casinos are responsible for most of the jobs created by the gambling industry, with 15,000 of the 16,000 jobs located there. Horseracing and wagering accounted for another 500 jobs, while lotteries created just 100 jobs.

The Donahue Institute expects the gambling industry to continue to grow in Massachusetts, due to continued population growth and rising incomes.

#  Idaho Casino Caught Cheating in Roulette Table




Idaho Casino was caught cheating in a roulette table. The casino has since been shut down and is under investigation by the state gaming board.

The cheating was first noticed by casino guests who noticed that the ball seemed to be landing in certain numbers more often than it should have. One guest even captured footage of the spinning ball that appeared to be manipulated.

The Idaho Gaming Board is currently investigating the matter and has not released any information yet. However, they have confirmed that the casino has been shut down and will not be reopening until the investigation is complete.

This isn't the first time a casino has been caught cheating. In fact, casino cheats are becoming more common as casinos try to find new ways to make money. However, this is one of the first times that a casino has been caught cheating with a roulette table.

It's unclear how long the investigation will take, but we will keep you updated as new information becomes available.

#  How to Tell if a Casino is Cheating in Roulette Table

There are a few telltale ways to determine if a casino is cheating in roulette, and we're going to go over them here.

# The Roulette Wheel

One of the giveaways that a casino is cheating is if the roulette wheel seems to be weighted. This can be determined by observing how often certain numbers come up. If you notice that one number keeps coming up more than others, it's likely that the casino has weighted the wheel in their favour.

Another way to tell if a casino is cheating with the roulette wheel is to watch the croupier. If they seem to be spinning the wheel in an unusual way, or messing with the ball, it's likely that they're doing something to help the casino cheat.

# The Roulette Table

The surface of the roulette table can also give away clues that a casino is cheating. If you see what looks like tape or glue around the betting area, it's likely that they're trying to keep players from winning. Another giveaway is if there are magnets under the table which are affecting where the ball ends up.

#  Idaho Casino Accused of Cheating in Roulette Table

The Treasure Valley Casino in Idaho is being accused of cheating by a group of players who were playing at the casino's roulette table. The players allege that the casino was using software to predict where the ball would land, allowing them to place winning bets.

The casino has denied any wrongdoing, but has agreed to refund the players' money and has closed the roulette table while it investigates the allegations.

This isn't the first time that allegations of cheating have been made against Treasure Valley Casino. In 2017, the casino paid out over $1 million to players who had won at its blackjack tables using similar software.

So far, there is no evidence that the casino is using software to cheat its customers, but the allegations are sure to cause some damage to its reputation. If it is found that the casino was cheating, it could face significant fines and even have its license revoked.

#  Roulette Table at Idaho Casino Found to be Rigged

The Idaho State Police have issued a statement that a roulette table at the Coeur D’Alene Casino Resort was found to be rigged. The table, which had been in use for less than two weeks, was shut down after casino personnel noticed that the ball seemed to be landing on certain numbers more often than it should.

According to police, the table was operated by two individuals, a man and a woman, who have both been arrested and charged with cheating. The pair are believed to have inserted magnets underneath the roulette wheel in order to influence the ball’s trajectory.

This is not the first time that a casino has been targeted by cheating scammers. In 2012, an Ohio man was caught using a hidden camera to cheat at blackjack, and in 2016 a group of Malaysian women were arrested for cheating at baccarat.

 Casinos employ various methods to prevent cheating, including security cameras and staff members who monitor the games. However, as these recent cases show, scam artists can still find ways to scam casinos out of money.

#  Casino in Idaho Suspected of Cheating in Roulette Table

According to the Idaho State Police, agents of the Treasure Valley Casino in Garden City have been suspected of cheating in their roulette table. The agents are allegedly using a technique called 'covered betting' to win at the game.

This technique is said to involve covering certain bets with others, in order to reduce the odds of losing money. Covered betting is illegal under Idaho law, and could lead to disciplinary action from the casino if it is found to be taking place.

The police department began their investigation into the casino after receiving a complaint from an unnamed individual. No arrests have yet been made, but the investigation is ongoing.

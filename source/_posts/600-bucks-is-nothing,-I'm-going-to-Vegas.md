#  600 bucks is nothing, I'm going to Vegas

I just cashed out my 600 bucks from my online poker game and I'm feeling great! I'm going to head over to Vegas and blow it all in one weekend.

I've always wanted to do this, and now I have the chance. I'm not even worried about the money, because 600 bucks is nothing. I can always make more money if I need to.

Plus, this will be a great opportunity to have some fun. I'm going to party like there's no tomorrow and enjoy myself to the fullest. Who knows, I might even end up winning big in Vegas!

Regardless of what happens, I know that this is going to be a weekend that I'll never forget. So bring on Vegas, baby!

#  I'm a millionaire now!

I'm a millionaire now and it feels great! I was able to achieve this goal by investing in cryptocurrencies and doing some day trading.

People laughed at me when I first mentioned that I was investing in cryptocurrencies, but now they all wish they had followed my lead. The returns have been amazing and it's only going to get better from here.

I started off by buying a small amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. I then began day trading these currencies and was able to make a lot of profit. Over time, I increased my investment and now I'm a millionaire.

If you're thinking about investing in cryptocurrencies, then don't wait any longer. The returns are incredible and there's no telling how high the prices will go. Get in while the getting is good!

#  600 bucks won, but I spent 2,000 in the process

###

I am a bit of a gambler. I like to take risks and see if I can win big. So when I found out about the 600-1 odds for the $2,000 Daily Double at the casino, I had to put down a bet.

I figured that even if I lost, I would only be out $600. But, as it turns out, I won! In fact, I won twice in a row for a total payout of $1,200.

So, technically, I made money on this gamble. But I still feel like I lost in the long run. After all, I spent $2,000 in order to make just $600. That's not really a good return on investment.

But still, it was exciting to win and to take home some extra cash. And it was definitely an adrenaline rush to risk so much and come away with a win. So while this gamble may not have been a wise decision financially, it was definitely enjoyable and exciting.

#  600 bucks won, now what?

Even if you're not planning on hitting the jackpot, there are still plenty of reasons to play Mega Millions. The game's huge payouts have made it one of the most popular nationwide lottery games in America. Playing Mega Millions is a great way to raise money for charity, and there are plenty of other fun ways to use your winnings.

If you're feeling lucky, now might be the time to try your luck and buy a ticket for this week's $600 million Mega Millions lottery drawing. This is the third-largest jackpot in the game's history, so there's a good chance somebody is going to hit it big. If that somebody happens to be you, here are some tips on how to handle your newfound wealth.

The obvious first step is to take some time to enjoy your winnings. Splurge on a new car or house, or go on a luxurious vacation. But once the initial excitement wears off, it's important to start thinking about the future.

If you don't have any pressing financial commitments, you can afford to be patient and take your time deciding what to do with your money. The key is not to rush into anything and make sure you do your research before investing in anything.

One option is to put your money into a high yield savings account or certificate of deposit (CD). This will allow you to earn interest on your money while keeping it safe from fluctuations in the stock market. You could also invest in stocks or mutual funds, but this carries more risk and you may not see as good of returns.

Whatever you decide, make sure you consult with an expert who can help you create a financial plan that meets your needs. Don't forget that tax implications should also be considered when making decisions about how to use your winnings.

If playing Mega Millions has taught us anything, it's that anyone has the potential to become a millionaire overnight. So if you're feeling lucky this week, don't hesitate and buy yourself a ticket!

#  Did I just become a statistic?

A few years ago, I was sitting in my apartment scrolling through Facebook when I saw an article that one in four women would be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. I remember sitting there in disbelief. I couldn't believe that it was that high of a statistic and even more so, that it could be me. Truthfully, up until that point I had never even considered the fact that I could be one of those women. 

Flash forward to last week when I was walking to my car after work and a man came up from behind me and groped me. The feeling of his hands on my body was completely unexpected and disgraceful. It made me feel small and violated. I immediately started crying and cursing myself for not being more aware of my surroundings. 

I know that there are people who will say things like "well, you shouldn't have been wearing that dress" or "you should have been more aware", but the reality is that this happens to women no matter what they are wearing or how aware they are. This is not our fault. This is not something we deserve. 

So, now what? How do we move forward? How do we make sure this doesn't happen to us or other women ever again? 

First and foremost, we need to talk about it. We need to talk about the fact that it's happening, we need to talk about how we're feeling, and we need to talk about ways to prevent it from happening in the future. We also need to be there for each other. If you see someone who has been affected by sexual assault, reach out to them, offer your support, and let them know that they are not alone. 

Second, we need to create safe spaces for ourselves and for other women. This could mean anything from joining a women's group or organization to simply creating a space in your home where you feel comfortable discussing these types of things openly without judgement. 

Lastly, we need to be vocal advocates for change. We need to demand change from our government officials, from our employers, and from society as a whole. We can start by creating petitions, writing letters, and speaking out against sexual assault whenever we have the opportunity. 

Change is possible but it will take all of us working together to make it happen. So, let's get started.

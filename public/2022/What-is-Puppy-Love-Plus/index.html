        <h1 id="What-is-Puppy-Love-Plus"><a href="#What-is-Puppy-Love-Plus" class="headerlink" title="What is Puppy Love Plus?"></a>What is Puppy Love Plus?</h1><p>Puppy Love Plus is an iPhone game that simulates the care and nurturing of a virtual puppy. The app is free to download and play, but players can also purchase in-game items with real money.</p>
<p>The object of the game is to keep the puppy happy by feeding it, taking it for walks, and cleaning up after it. The puppy also has moods which players must try to keep positive by playing games, petting it, and giving it treats. In addition to the main character, players can also choose from a variety of breeds of puppies such as labs, beagles, golden retrievers, and Shih Tzus.</p>
<p>One of the things that make Puppy Love Plus so popular is that it is one of the few games that allows players to adopt a virtual pet. Most other pet apps require users to take care of an existing animal, but with Puppy Love Plus, players get to create their own pet from scratch. This gives players a sense of ownership and responsibility for their furry friend.</p>
<p>Since its release in early 2014, Puppy Love Plus has been downloaded over 10 million times and has received high marks from critics and users alike. Apple even selected it as one of their App Store Best Apps of 2014.</p>

<h1 id="What-is-the-release-date-of-Puppy-Love-Plus"><a href="#What-is-the-release-date-of-Puppy-Love-Plus" class="headerlink" title="What is the release date of Puppy Love Plus?"></a>What is the release date of Puppy Love Plus?</h1><p>The release date of Puppy Love Plus is currently unknown.

<p>Puppy Love Plus is a dating sim game for the Nintendo Switch. It is developed by Navel, the creators of the acclaimed otome game series Harvest Moon. The game stars a young girl named Mei, who must balance her love life with her responsibilities as queen of the animals.</p>
<p>The game has received mixed reactions from fans so far. Some players are excited for it, citing the charming artwork and unique premise. Others are more skeptical, citing the lackluster gameplay of Harvest Moon and other dating sims. However, it is still too early to say whether or not Puppy Love Plus will be a success or not.</p>
<p>No official release date has been announced yet, but we will update this article as soon as we know more. In the meantime, keep an eye on Navel’s Twitter page for updates!</p>

<h1 id="Is-there-a-Puppy-Love-Plus-bonus-for-new-players"><a href="#Is-there-a-Puppy-Love-Plus-bonus-for-new-players" class="headerlink" title="Is there a Puppy Love Plus bonus for new players?"></a>Is there a Puppy Love Plus bonus for new players?</h1><p>When you first start playing Puppy Love Plus there is no indication that there is any kind of bonus waiting for you. However, if you look a little closer you will find that there is in fact a hidden bonus waiting for new players.</p>
<p>All you have to do to unlock the bonus is play through the game’s initial 10 chapters. Once you have completed all 10 chapters you will be rewarded with a special bonus scene featuring the game’s two main love interests.</p>
<p>The bonus scene features some pretty hot moments between the two characters so it’s definitely worth completing the main game in order to unlock it!</p>

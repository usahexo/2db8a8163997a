        <h1 id="March-Madness-Generates-Millions-in-Casino-Revenue"><a href="#March-Madness-Generates-Millions-in-Casino-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="March Madness Generates Millions in Casino Revenue"></a>March Madness Generates Millions in Casino Revenue</h1><p>The NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Tournament, better known as March Madness, is one of the most popular sporting events in the United States. Starting on Selection Sunday and concluding with the championship game on April 2, the tournament features 68 teams competing in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion.</p>
<p>March Madness is estimated to generate over $10 billion in economic impact each year, including over $2 billion in lost productivity from fans watching the games at work. But what about casinos? How does March Madness impact gambling revenues?</p>
<p>A study by WalletHub looked at the gambling revenue generated by each state during the first two rounds of the tournament since 2014. They then compared that data to states’ populations and other relevant factors.</p>
<p>The study found that Nevada, home to Las Vegas and numerous other casinos, generates by far the most gambling revenue during March Madness. In fact, Nevada’s gambling revenue during the first two rounds of the tournament is more than four times larger than that of any other state.</p>
<p>Louisiana, Missouri, Michigan, and Indiana round out the top five states for gambling revenue during March Madness. All of these states have large populations and are home to major casinos. Conversely, Alaska – which has neither a large population nor any major casinos – brought in less than $1 million in gambling revenue during March Madness from 2014-2016.</p>
<p>So what can we take away from all this? If you want to make some serious money gambling during March Madness, head to Nevada. Otherwise, you may be better off watching from home!</p>
<h1 id="292-Million-in-Gambling-Revenue-from-March-Madness"><a href="#292-Million-in-Gambling-Revenue-from-March-Madness" class="headerlink" title="$292 Million in Gambling Revenue from March Madness"></a>$292 Million in Gambling Revenue from March Madness</h1><p>$292 million was wagered on the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in March, according to the American Gaming Association. That breaks down to an average of $10.67 spent on each of the 27.5 million brackets entered into office pools, online betting pools and other forms of gambling associated with the tournament.</p>
<p>The $292 million is up from $288 million wagered last year and is a record for annual gambling on the NCAA Tournament. This year’s total includes an estimated $7 billion bet illegally through bookmakers and offshore websites.</p>
<p>The AGA said that if bets placed legally through Nevada sportsbooks are included, then the total amount wagered balloons to more than $11 billion.</p>
<p>Nevada books took in nearly $12 million in bets on the NCAA tourney in March, including another record $1.2 million bet on Tuesday’s national championship game between Virginia and Texas Tech. That’s up from the previous high of $10.8 million set last year when Duke beat Michigan State in the title game.</p>
<h1 id="March-Madness-Tops-250-Million-in-Gambling-Revenues"><a href="#March-Madness-Tops-250-Million-in-Gambling-Revenues" class="headerlink" title="March Madness Tops $250 Million in Gambling Revenues"></a>March Madness Tops $250 Million in Gambling Revenues</h1><p>The NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament is a 68-team bracket contest that starts with Selection Sunday on March 17 and culminates in the National Championship game on April 8. The popularity of the annual event has grown so much in recent years that it now generates more than $250 million in gambling revenues.</p>
<p>Americans wagered $9.2 billion on sports bets last year, and the March Madness tournament accounted for about a third of that amount. In Nevada, where gambling is legal, the total amount bet on the men’s basketball tournament was $168 million, and the state earned $11 million in tax revenue from those wagers.</p>
<p>The growth of legalized gambling in the United States and elsewhere has contributed to the increase in betting on the NCAA Tournament. In addition, new technologies such as online and mobile betting have made it easier for fans to place their bets. And with states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania now offering legal sports betting, that number is only going to grow.</p>
<p>March Madness has also become a huge source of revenue for the NCAA. The organization earns about $800 million annually from its television contract with CBS and Turner Broadcasting. And it will earn even more this year thanks to all of the additional gambling activity.</p>
<p>The NCAA has long been opposed to legalized gambling, but it appears that it is now resigned to the fact that it is here to stay. In a statement issued last year, the NCAA said, “We recognize that [gambling] is a major enterprise in our country and has become an important part of American culture. As we continue our ongoing efforts against legalized sports wagering, we also will monitor any potential new legislation or court decisions related to sports wagering that could impact college sports.”</p>
<h1 id="Illicit-Gambling-Fuels-9-Billion-in-March-Madness-Revenue"><a href="#Illicit-Gambling-Fuels-9-Billion-in-March-Madness-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Illicit Gambling Fuels $9 Billion in March Madness Revenue"></a>Illicit Gambling Fuels $9 Billion in March Madness Revenue</h1><p>$9 billion is a staggering amount of money, and it’s not just the GDP of a small country — it’s the amount of revenue that is brought in by illicit gambling every year in the United States. This number was released by the American Gaming Association (AGA) as part of their 2018 report, which also detailed that this illicit gambling accounts for up to 10% of all casino gaming revenue. </p>
<p>This underground economy hurts not only casinos but also state and local governments, who are missing out on billions in revenue each year due to illegal gambling activities. In fact, the AGA report estimates that states and localities are losing out on $2.7 billion in revenue from taxes and fees associated with legal gaming. </p>
<p>There are a number of ways to gamble illegally, but one of the most popular is through office pools. These pools allow participants to bet on things like who will win each game or how many points will be scored. Office pools are technically legal as long as there is no money being wagered and no paid employees running them, but they often skirt around this rule by asking participants to make a donation to cover costs. </p>
<p>Another popular way to gamble illegally is through so-called “charity” lotteries. These lotteries work similarly to office pools, but instead of betting on games they involve betting on lottery numbers. The difference between charity lotteries and office pools, though, is that charity lotteries are actually illegal. Despite this, they continue to thrive thanks to the internet and social media platforms like Facebook. </p>
<p>State governments have been trying to crackdown on these activities for years, but it’s an uphill battle given how easy it is for people to participate in them anonymously online. In fact, many states have seen their revenues from legal gaming decline in recent years as people move away from traditional forms of gambling towards these more illicit alternatives. </p>
<p>While $9 billion may seem like a lot of money, it’s only a fraction of the total amount that is gambled illegally every year. Estimates put this number at closer to $40 billion, which means that the fight against illegal gambling is far from over.</p>
<h1 id="March-Madness-A-Billion-Dollar-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#March-Madness-A-Billion-Dollar-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="March Madness: A Billion-Dollar Gambling Industry"></a>March Madness: A Billion-Dollar Gambling Industry</h1><p>The NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship, popularly known as March Madness, is a single-elimination tournament played each year by 68 college basketball teams. The annual championship tournament generates more than $1 billion in betting activity, making it one of the most popular and lucrative gambling events in the world.</p>
<p>March Madness is unique among major sporting events because of the wide range of bets that can be placed on the tournament. In addition to traditional bets on the outcome of individual games, wagers can also be placed on the winner of the tournament, who will make the Final Four, and which teams will receive bids to participate in the championship.</p>
<p>The growth of online sportsbooks has led to a surge in betting on March Madness in recent years. In 2017, Americans wagered a record $10.4 billion on the tournament, with nearly half of that total bet online. With so much money at stake, online sportsbooks are eagerly anticipating this year’s tournament, and are offering a wide variety of betting options to their customers.</p>
<p>Bookmakers are confident that gambling interest in March Madness will only continue to grow in future years. As legal gambling options continue to expand in the United States, more and more people are expected to bet on the NCAA tournament. This could result in even bigger payouts for those who correctly predict the outcome of this year’s games.</p>

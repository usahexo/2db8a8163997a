The figures reveal that the club are now England’s 18th richest club with a total wealth of £101 million, according to financial data company Deloitte.</p>
<p>The Seagulls were promoted to the Premier League for the first time in 2017 and enjoyed a successful season in the top-flight, finishing in 15th place. The revenue generated from their maiden campaign in the Premier League helped increase Brighton’s overall wealth by £24 million from the previous year.</p>
<p>The club’s chairman Tony Bloom commented on the findings, saying: “Our ambition is to continue to grow the club both on and off the pitch, and these latest figures demonstrate that we are moving in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Brighton’s rise up the footballing ladder has been impressive, with their total wealth now just £5 million behind 12th placed Watford. In 2013, when Bloom purchased a majority stake in Brighton, they were ranked as England’s 92nd richest club with a total wealth of £8 million.</p>
<p>Albion have benefitted hugely from increased broadcasting revenue and commercial income in recent years, with shirt sponsorship deals with American Express and Simspons proving particularly lucrative. The value of television rights has also surged in recent times, with BT Sport paying £885 million for exclusive live rights to broadcast Premier League games for three seasons from 2019&#x2F;20. This represents a 71% increase on their previous deal.</p>

In doing so, he has helped the club earn promotion to the Premier League for the first time in its history.</p>
